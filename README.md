# PLY-tool
* PLY is a pure-Python implementation of the popular compiler construction tools LEX and YACC. PLY is an implementation of LEX and YACC parsing tools for Python. Main Features:
* It's implemented entirely in Python.
* It uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars.
* PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for ambiguous grammars.
* PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.
* The language chosen in this project is python and the constructs are:
i) Array Declaration
ii) Simple Declaration
iii) Arithmetic Expression
iv) Loops
v) Conditional if..else statement
